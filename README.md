# MathJax-grunt-cleaner

A grunt file to reduce the footprint of a MathJax installation

* Fetch a copy of MathJax `wget https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip`
* copy & rename the `template` task
* comment out the components you want to keep (perhaps **counterintuitive**)

See the comments in file for more details and caveats.
